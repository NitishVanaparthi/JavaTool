Chain Recursion:

If there are two method Method a()  and b() and 
if a called from b and b is called from 
then both the functions are said to be in chain recursion.

Binary Search:

Consider if there are 100 elements and there index numbers are stored in an array
and asked to trace an element from the elements 
then MIN+MAX/2 and compare the tracing element with the mid element 
if mid>trasing element then continue your search towards right of the array 
as mid+High/2 and compare till you find the element you are actually tracing for. 

Tower of Honoi:

Tower of Honoi contains three bars with names A, B and C where A contains 5(n) disks consider it as stack move 1 to b and then c
and two to b and 1 back to 2 and three to b and so on
